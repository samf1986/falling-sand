# Falling Sand

A simple falling-sand simulation written in Python using NumPy and Pygame.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the simulation:

```bash
python phys.py
```

Controls:
- Q: Sand
- W: Water
- E: Wall
- T: Plant-dry
- R: Eraser
- C: Clear
- \[ / \]: Brush size
- Esc: Quit

## Notes

Numba is optional; the simulator will run without it but JIT acceleration makes it faster.
